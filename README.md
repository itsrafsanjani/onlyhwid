# Welcome! Here you can:
Activate Windows 10/11 using MAS HWID script, no KMS or any of that. This will always be updated.

# What's this for exactly? 
Activating via HWID, we stripped down the Microsoft Activation Scripts so its a little lighter and added the only required files for HWID activation.

# What do I do?
Run the bat, and click the HWID Activation button.
